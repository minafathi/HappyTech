Case Study
**********

The company HappyTech is growing and advertises a significant number of positions. Therefore, the
number of applications they have to deal with is increasing too. The company’s policy is to respond to
both the successful and unsuccessful applications by sending them feedback. As writing up letters for
every applicant takes a lot of time, the company identified an ontology that could be used by a software
application to generate the feedback. The feedback application will be used by anybody involved in
reviewing the applications.

The main tasks the user has to perform are:

1. Create, edit, delete a template

A template has
• a header containing relevant information about the person the feedback is for, the person
giving the feedback and what the feedback is for (CV, interview, technical interview, etc)
• a number of sections. Each section contains a title, a list of pairs of codes and the comments
to be included in the feedback. The template can be used to review the applications for one
or more positions advertised.

2.Generate feedback

Before the feedback writing process starts, the template to be used has to be selected. The
feedback window contains the header, the sections with the codes that can be selected via
checkboxes or radio buttons and a text box for free comment. The feedback is saved as a pdf file
using the applicant’s code or name.

3.Email the applicants the feedback.

The emails should be sent automatically, in bulk once all interviews for a position are completed.
Extra feature
The online system should allow the candidates to upload their CV.
Requirements
Your team has been tasked with developing a prototype which meets the requirements as laid out
above.
